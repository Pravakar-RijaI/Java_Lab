For running JAVA programs in eclipse:
1. Create a New Java Project:
	Go to File > New > Java Project.
	Enter a project name (e.g., “MyJavaProject”) and click “Finish.”
2. Create a New Java Class:
	Right-click on the src folder in the Project Explorer.
	Select New > Class.
	Enter a class name (e.g., “MyMainClass”) and 
	check the option to include the public static void main(String[] args) method.
	Click “Finish.”
3. Write Your Main Method:
	Eclipse will generate a skeleton for your main method. You can add your code inside it.
	For example:
	public class MyMainClass {
    		public static void main(String[] args) {
        		System.out.println("Hello, world!");
    		}
	}
4. Run Your Program:
	Right-click on your class file (MyMainClass.java) in the Project Explorer.
	Select Run As > Java Application.
You’ll see the output in the Console view.
